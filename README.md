# minishell - A Minimal UNIX Shell

## 🛠️ Project Overview

`minishell` is a minimalistic UNIX shell built as part of the 42 curriculum. This project replicates key features of Bash, allowing users to execute commands, manage processes, and handle environment variables. The goal is to understand how a shell interacts with the operating system while implementing core shell functionalities.

## 🚀 Features
- **Command Execution** - Supports built-in and external commands.
- **Pipes (`|`)** - Enables command chaining through pipes.
- **Redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`, `<<`)** - Implements file input/output redirections.
- **Environment Variables (`export`, `$VAR`)** - Allows variable manipulation.
- **Signal Handling** - Handles `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\` for process control.
- **Process Management** - Supports foreground and background execution.
- **Basic Parsing & Tokenization** - Splits and interprets user commands.

## 🕹️ Usage

### Running Minishell
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
